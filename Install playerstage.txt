**********************************************
Step 2 : Install Player

Create a new directory as you desire.

mkdir PlayerStageSvn
Go to that directory

cd PlayerStageSvn
Download the Player/Stage and so on from the sources

svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/playerstage/svn/ playerstage-svn
Go to the directory of player-<version>

cd player-<3.0.2>
Create a build directory

mkdir build
Go to the build directory

cd build
cmake in that directory

cmake ../
make

make
install the Player

sudo make install
**********************************************
Step 3 : When errors ap
The first error that I had is not the boost signals but Time_UTC, we have the change the TIME_UTC to TIME_UTC_
 

 

Go to the directory of libplayerc++

cd ../ client_libs/libplayerc++
Open the text file of playerclient  

gedit playerclient.cc &
 

Search for the TIME_UTC, and change it into TIME_UTC_

The second error is the path related one, run the following command in your terminal:
export PATH=$PATH:"/usr/local/lib64"

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"/usr/local/lib":"/usr/local/lib64"

export PLAYERPATH="/usr/local/lib":"/usr/local/lib64"

export STAGEPATH="/usr/local/lib":"/usr/local/lib64"

Run the .bashrc file:

source .bashrc

*******************************
Step 4 : Install Stage
Even though we download the stage in the source, due to version issue, it is really hard to get it installed.
Trying to search on line, perhaps there is a newest version for the Stage, and it is stage<4.1.1>.
Download the latest version from this website: 
From the website, we know that the newest version released in 2012 is 4.1.1
 

https://github.com/rtv/stage/releases
 

After you download stage at your download directory...

Go to the Download directory

cd Downloads/
unzip the stage

unzip Stage-4.1.1.zip
Go to the stage directory

cd stage-4.1.1/
make a build directory

mkdir build
Go the build directory

cd build
make it

make ../
make it

make
install the stage

sudo make install
The same path related error might show up again, just type the same command as we did for the Player.

export PATH=$PATH:"/usr/local/lib64"

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"/usr/local/lib":"/usr/local/lib64"

export PLAYERPATH="/usr/local/lib":"/usr/local/lib64"

export STAGEPATH="/usr/local/lib":"/usr/local/lib64"

and rerun the .bashrc file again

source .bashrc
Step 5 : Test your Stage
First ensure that player is in the PATH, by typing: (This should result in the following output to the terminal window:<INSTALL_DIR>/bin/player)

which player
Second ensure that stage is in the PATH, by typing:(This should result in the following output to the terminal window:<INSTALL_DIR>/bin/stage)

which stage
Go to the directory where you install Stage

cd Stage-4.1.1/
Go to worlds subdirectory under the Stage

cd worlds/
Execute the following command, you should see the window of Stage!

stage simple.world
